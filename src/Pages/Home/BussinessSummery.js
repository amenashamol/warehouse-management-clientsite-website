       In the past three years, Drill Machine has grown by 150%. We attribute that growth to our commitment to identifying new clients and markets and hope to double that within the next two years. Currently, we are seeking an investment of $60,000 to help scale our company and grow our team across the United States
      To date, the Company has raised approximately $6.0 million to support research and development, product introduction to the Telco market and initial sales. The Company seeks to raise an additional $5.0 million to fund its growth. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and expansion of the sales and marketing efforts. FOA's business plan projects that annual sales will reach the $34.0 million level by the fifth year with net after-tax profits of approximately $10.8 million.
